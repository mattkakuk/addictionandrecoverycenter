## **Who We Are – Florida Addiction and Recovery Center**

We are more than a treatment facility. We are a partner in your healing
journey.

### **Our Philosophy on Mental Health Care**

At Florida Addiction and Recovery Center, we treat the whole person—not just
symptoms. We understand that mental health conditions often stem from a mix of
biological, psychological, and social factors.

### **First-Person, Client-Focused Care**

We work _with_ you, not above you. From day one, we listen, we adapt, and we
personalize your treatment plan.

## **Understanding Mental Health Conditions We Treat**

Mental health is not one-size-fits-all, and neither is our care.

### **Anxiety Disorders**

Chronic worry, panic attacks, and social anxiety can shrink your world. We
help expand it again—safely and gradually.

### **Depression and Mood Disorders**

Depression can feel like living under a constant gray cloud. Our treatment
helps bring back color, energy, and hope.

### **Bipolar Disorder Support**

We help clients stabilize mood swings and build consistent routines that
support long-term wellness.

## **Dual Diagnosis – When Mental Health and Addiction Intersect**

Mental health and substance use often walk hand in hand.

### **Why Dual Diagnosis Treatment Matters**

Treating addiction without addressing mental health is like fixing a leak
without turning off the water. We provide integrated dual diagnosis care to
treat both simultaneously.

### **Conditions Commonly Treated Together**

  * Anxiety and alcohol use
  * Depression and prescription drug misuse
  * PTSD and substance dependency

This comprehensive approach defines our[ **mental health treatment Fort

responsibilities.

### **Step-Down Care for Long-Term Success**

We gradually transition clients through levels of care to build independence
and resilience.

## **Evidence-Based Therapies We Use**

We rely on proven methods—not trends.

### **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**

CBT helps identify negative thought patterns and replace them with healthier
ones. Think of it as rewiring mental habits.

### **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)**

DBT focuses on emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal
effectiveness.

### **Trauma-Informed Therapy**

We recognize that trauma often sits at the root of mental health struggles.
Our approach prioritizes safety, trust, and empowerment.

Mental wellness goes beyond talk therapy.
