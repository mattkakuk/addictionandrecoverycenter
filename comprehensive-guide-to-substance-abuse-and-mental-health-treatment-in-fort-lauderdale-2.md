## **Key Components of Substance Abuse Treatment**

### **1\. Medical Detoxification**

Detoxification is often the first step, medically supervised to safely manage
withdrawal symptoms. This process paves the way for ongoing therapy and
recovery efforts.

therapies. It effectively reduces withdrawal symptoms and cravings.
