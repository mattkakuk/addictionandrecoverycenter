### **What is Medically Assisted Treatment (MAT)?**

#### **Definition and Overview**

Medically Assisted Treatment, often referred to as MAT, combines medication
with counseling and behavioral therapies to treat substance use disorders. It
targets the brain's physiology, alleviating withdrawal symptoms and curbing
cravings, which significantly increases the likelihood of sustained recovery.

#### **The Role of Medication in MAT**

In our **substance abuse treatment facilities in Fort Lauderdale** ,
medications like Suboxone, naltrexone, and methadone are used as part of a
comprehensive recovery plan. These medications help normalize brain chemistry,
reduce physical discomfort, and improve mental health outcomes.
