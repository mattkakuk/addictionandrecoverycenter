## The Importance of Addressing Substance Abuse and Mental Health Together

### Why Integrate Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment?

Many individuals battling substance abuse also struggle with underlying mental
health issues like anxiety, depression, or trauma. Treating one without the
other can often lead to relapse or incomplete recovery. We believe in a
**holistic approach** , addressing both concurrently to foster genuine
healing.

**Question** to ponder: isn’t it time to treat the root causes rather than
just symptoms? That’s why **Florida Addiction and Recovery Center** combines
**mental health treatment** with **substance abuse therapies** under one roof.
