## **Understanding Substance Abuse and Mental Health Challenges**

### **What Is Substance Abuse?**

Substance abuse refers to the harmful or hazardous use of substances such as
alcohol, opioids, stimulants, or other drugs. This pattern can interfere with
daily life, relationships, and overall health. Chronic substance abuse often
leads to substance dependence, where the individual finds it difficult to
function without the substance.

### **The Relationship Between Substance Abuse and Mental Health**

Many individuals struggling with mental health issues, such as depression or
anxiety, turn to substances as a form of self-medication. This can create a
vicious cycle, worsening both conditions. Recognizing the interconnected
nature of these challenges underscores the importance of comprehensive mental
health and substance use treatment.

struggles. It empowers individuals to develop coping mechanisms and
resilience.
